### Exercise 14

**Question:** 

Given a list I of n intervals, specified as (x_i , y_i ) pairs, return a list where
the overlapping intervals are merged. For I = {(1, 3), (2, 6), (8, 10), (7, 18)} the
output should be {(1, 6), (7, 18)}. Your algorithm should run in worst-case
O(n log n) time complexity.

**Answer:**
