### Exercise 12

**Question:** 

Give an efficient algorithm to compute the union of sets A and B, where
n = max(|A|, |B|). The output should be an array of distinct elements that form
the union of the sets.

**Answer:**

(a)
- Reverse sort the arrays.
- Initalize an empty output array
- While loop (setA or setB has length > 0;)
- Pop the smallest defined value off between set A and B
- If the value we've popped off is equal the end of the output array, discard the value
- else, add the value to the output stack

(b)
- Same as (a) without sorting.
